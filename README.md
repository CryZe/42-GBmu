# 42-GBmu
A GB Emulator Written in Rust

## What is GBmu?
GBmu is a project in the 42 curriculum. The goals of the project are to create a fully functioning app, as well as learn about emulation and electronic documentation.  

## Why Rust?
I have no prior knowledge of Rust, so I figure this will be a fun time learning it the hard way.
